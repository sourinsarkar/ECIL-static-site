                <h1 class="htype3" style="font-size:40px;">Renewable electricity needs to grow 55-fold to achieve zero emission in India by 2050: Study</h1>
                <img src="subpageimg1.jpg" alt="Solar Panel" style="float:left;width:300px;height:200px;margin:10px;">
                    <p class="justified">New Delhi, Mar 22 (PTI) Renewables in electricity must increase 55-fold for India to achieve net-zero 
                    emissions by 2050, according to a report by <abbr title="Council on Energy, Environment and Waste">CEEW</abbr>. India will need to generate 
                    at least 83 per cent of its electricity from (non-hydro power) renewable energy sources by 2050 to achieve net-zero 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse" class="links" targer="_blank">greenhouse</a> gas emissions by mid-century, according to the study.</p>

                    <p class="justified">This would mean a massive 55-fold increase in the use of non-hydro renewables in electricity generation within the coming 
                    three decades, from only <b>160</b> Terawatt-hour (TWh) (10 per cent) in 2019, CEEW said in a statement.</p>
                    
                    <p class="justified">Further, to achieve net-zero by 2050 the share of electricity in India's industrial energy use must rise three-fold, from 
                    20.3 per cent in 2018 to 70 per cent in 2050, the study - <cite>Peaking and Net-Zero for India's Energy Sector CO2 Emissions</cite>: 
                    An Analytical Exposition - revealed.</p>
                    
                    <p class="justified">The share of electric vehicles in passenger car sales will also have to rise to 76 per cent by 2050 from just 0.1 per cent 
                    in 2019, it added.
                    These estimates are based on CEEW's best understanding of progress on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitigation" class="links" target="_blank">mitigation</a> technologies.</p>
                    
                    <p class="justified">To meet net-zero, India will need to either eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or balance these by sequestering GHG 
                    emissions.</p>
                    
                    <p class="justified">The study is the first exercise to outline multiple pathways for India to attain net-zero emissions, rather than fixating 
                    on a single scenario or a single year.</p>
                    
                    <p class="justified">It highlighted that India will need to reach peak emissions within this decade if it were to achieve net-zero emissions 
                    by mid-century, a pace of transition, unlike anything the world has seen before.</p>
                    
                    <p class="justified">This will give India an extremely narrow window to ensure a smooth and equitable transition from a peaking year to a 
                    net-zero year.</p>
                    
                    <p class="justified">Advanced economies, including China, Japan, the UK, and the US, will have taken at least 30, and at times well over 40 
                    years for this transition. Advanced economies peaked emissions at much higher levels of development, slower rates of 
                    growth and would have had longer transition periods, it added. '...We find that India would need to undergo a double 
                    transition, through faster electrification of sectors and an increasing share of renewables in power generation, if it 
                    were to announce an ambitious net-zero target,' Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Fellow at CEEW, and author of the study said.</p>
